# Unnamed actual project

**Overview:**  
This site is a wiki-style repository. It’s built to be fully customizable and user-friendly, so it can be edited and expanded site without needing to touch the code. Everything revolves around creating a living, breathing collection of character profiles, lore, and visual elements.

The goal? To have a centralized hub for OC-related content that’s easy to maintain, fun to explore, and dynamic enough to evolve as the lore expands.

## Features  
- **Wiki for OCs:**  
  - Each character gets their own page.  
  - Pages include text, images, styled backgrounds, and interactive elements.  
  - Organized into "In-Universe" and "Out-of-Universe" categories for easy browsing.  

- **Remote Editing:**  
  - Can edit everything through a user-friendly admin dashboard (no coding required!).  
  - Add new pages, update text/images, and change styles directly from the browser.  
  - Fully integrated with GitHub for backup and version control.  

- **Dynamic Navigation:**  
  - The character list (both in-universe and out-of-universe) updates automatically whenever a new page is created.  
  - No manual navbar edits—everything is handled dynamically.

- **Responsive Design:**  ---- UNSURE OF SINCE THE INCIDENT ----
  - Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## How It Works
1. **Pages**:  
   Each character's page is a standalone `.ejs` file (e.g., `Felix.ejs`) that includes their specific lore and styling.  
   Templates make it easy to create new pages without starting from scratch.  

2. **Admin Dashboard**:  
   The dashboard allows Moon to:  
   - Edit character pages.  
   - Create new pages using pre-set templates.  
   - Change global styles, like fonts or navbar settings.  

3. **GitHub Integration**:  
   All changes are synced with GitHub, providing version control and backup. Even if something breaks, you can roll back to a previous state.

4. **Parallax and Visual Effects**:  
   Optional features, like parallax scrolling or background animations, can be added to individual pages for visual flair.

## To-Do List  
1. Finalize **parallax scrolling** (ensure it’s customizable per page).  
2. Build the **admin dashboard** to allow Moon to create, edit, and manage pages seamlessly.  
3. Add **tooltips/tutorials** to explain each editable field in the dashboard.  
4. Push everything live and test remote editing functionality.
